# Kalman-Filtered-Blob-Tracker
A project that uses kalman filter to estimate a blob position
To compile:
delete the folder build
-remake the folder
-build
-cmake..
-make.

Current progress: Added Kalman filter to blobs and demonstrated usage of Object oriented programming. 

Imrpovements to be done, augment the hungarian algorithm. Get a better GPU and detect objects using tensorflow.

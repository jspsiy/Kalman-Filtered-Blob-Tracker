# Kalman-Filtered-Blob-Tracker
A project that uses kalman filter to estimate a blob position


To compile:
1. delete the folder "build"
2. mkdir build
3. cmake ..
4. make


to use type ./ball_tracker

Current progress: Added Kalman filter to blobs and demonstrated usage of Object oriented programming. 

Imrpovements to be done, augment the hungarian algorithm. Get a better GPU and detect objects using tensorflow.
